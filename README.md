## Introduction
A simple, learning project that uses OpenCV to detect hand in webcam and then send the hand movement's data to Unity to display & interact in the virtual environment.

## Features
* OpenCV for hand detection.
* Integration of computer vision into Unity environment.

## Package requirements
- `opencv`, `cvzone` 

## Running the project
- Once you've cloned the project, create a virtual env (venv) and copy/paste the script `main.py` into the venv folder. 
- Run `main.py` and open Unity project and Play the scene, webcam will start and hand will show in Unity scene.

## Attribute
The project follows the instructions in [CVZone](https://www.computervision.zone/) as a starting point.
